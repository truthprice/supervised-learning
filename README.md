# Supervised-Learning

## Description

The purpose and motivation of this project was to using supervised machine learning to create models that will predict whether a loan will be approved or not. The two models used for the data were a logistic regression and a random forest classifier. The train-test-split method was used to fit the data and create the models. The models were then scored to determine which model was best. After creating the models, it was determined that both models were excellent for predicting loan approval. However, the logistic regression performed slightly better.
